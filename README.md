The Homework is a fully functional and interactive homework planner app that can allow the user to perform the following tasks: 

1-Enter an item; 

2- Edit an item; 

3- Delete an item; 

4- Mark the task as completed. 

5- Unmarked the task as completed. 

 

A purple blue background color;  

A pink (#d76868); 

 centered rectangular frame with an original width of and Height of. 

Inside the rectangular frame, there is  

H1: color =; purple blue 

Input field under the H1 separated by the 1.5 rem space, border radius 8px, border weight 8px. With a placeholder inside. 

A submit button at left of the input field; It has the same height as the input field, border radius 5px, font family serif, font weight bold 

     - When the user submits a new task, the task will appear below the input field and the submit button. The task appears as a long centered horizontal rectangle having inside of it. 

The task horizontally aligned to the left; the edit icon follows by the delete icon both horizontally aligned to the right.  

When the user clicks on the task, it changes its color to green and the text takes the “line through” property. 

When the user clicks on the edit icon, a new input field and an Update Task button pop up below the first one with a 1.5 rem space between them allowing the user to modify the task. After modifications the user clicks on the button and the new items all disappear.  

When the delete button is clicked, the task is cleared from the screen. 

Notes: The app is a responsive application, and its length is adjusted as the user adds and deletes items. 

To build the app, I used the followings: 

CSS for styling 

React.js because of its convenience and the reusability of its components. I used its “use State” hook to easily track the state of the different elements of the app. 

For the icons, I used React-icons library because they give the possibility to import only what I need and then do not reduce the efficiency of the page. Also React Icon library already contains man
